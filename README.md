I solved the Pascal Triangle Problem on [LeetCode](leetcode.com)
The Worst case time complexity is O(n2)
Looking through other solutions, they also have runtime of O(n2) except if the triangle arrays are hardcoded whereby the algorithm have a runtime of O(1)

These repo contain Algorithm exercises on various websites such as
[LeetCode](leetcode.com)
running_sum.py : Calculates the running sum of an array of int
is_palindrome.py: Checks whether a number is a palindrome
roman_to_int.py: Converts a roman numeral to an integer
