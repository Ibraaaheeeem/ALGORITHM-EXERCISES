I solved the Pascal Triangle II problem on [LeetCode](leetcode.com)
There are two solutions
- 1 This solution utilize the formula for nth row using serial combinations available on [GeeksFoGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pascals-triangle-formula/),
- 2 The second solution  iteratively calculates each row, deriving the subsequent row until our desired row is reached.

I solved the Pascal Triangle Problem on [LeetCode](leetcode.com)
The Worst case time complexity is O(n2)
Looking through other solutions, they also have runtime of O(n2) except if the triangle arrays are hardcoded whereby the algorithm have a runtime of O(1)

These repo contain Algorithm exercises on various websites such as
